<h1>Introducing django startproject plus</h1>
<p>by {{ page.author }} on {{ page.date | date_to_long_string}}.</p>

<p>
  The custom template functionality on Django's startproject command is great, but unfortunatelly it <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/django-admin/#startproject-projectname-destination">doesn't support passing extra variables to the context</a>. This is not very helpful with more complex template setups.
</p>

<p>
  So I created a very simple wrapper around Django's startproject command. It supersets the command by adding support for passing extra context to the template.
</p>

<p>
  Because this command is a drop-in replacement it can be invoked with the same flags that startproject supports.
</p>

<p>
  This issue has been brought up to the <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18277">django-devs mailing list</a>. But it has ended up as a documentation amend unless there is more demand for this.
</p>

<p>
  Since I have an need for this I decided to create this simple script, which I bundled as package to make it easier to use.
</p>

<p>
  The source code is available in github: <a href="https://github.com/alfredo/django-startproject-plus">https://github.com/alfredo/django-startproject-plus</a>. Please do report any issues you find with it.
